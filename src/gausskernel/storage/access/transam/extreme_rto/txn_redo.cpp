 * txn_redo.cpp
 *      TxnRedoWorker runs in the dispatcher thread to easy the management
 *      of transaction status and global variables.  In principle, we can
 *      run the TxnRedoWorker in a separate thread, but we don't do it for
 *      now for simplicity.
 *      To ensure read consistency on hot-standby replicas, transactions on
 *      replicas must commit in the same order as the master.  This is the
 *      main reason to use a dedicated worker to replay transaction logs.
 *      To ensure data consistency within a transaction, the transaction
 *      commit log must be replayed after all data logs for the transaction
 *      have been replayed by PageRedoWorkers.
