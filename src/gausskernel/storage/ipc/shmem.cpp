 *
 * openGauss processes share one or more regions of shared memory.
 * The shared memory is created by a postmaster and is inherited
 * by each backend via fork() (or, in some ports, via other OS-specific
 * methods).  The routines in this file are used for allocating and
 * binding to shared memory data structures.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *		(a) There are three kinds of shared memory data structures
 *	available to openGauss: fixed-size structures, queues and hash
 *	tables.  Fixed-size structures contain things like global variables
 *	for a module and should never be allocated after the shared memory
 *	initialization phase.  Hash tables have a fixed maximum size, but
 *	their actual size can vary dynamically.  When entries are added
 *	to the table, more space is allocated.	Queues link data structures
 *	that have been allocated either within fixed-size structures or as hash
 *	buckets.  Each shared data structure has a string name to identify
 *	it (assigned in the module that declares it).
 *
 *		(b) During initialization, each module looks for its
 *	shared data structures in a hash table called the "Shmem Index".
 *	If the data structure is not present, the caller can allocate
 *	a new one and initialize it.  If the data structure is present,
 *	the caller "attaches" to the structure by initializing a pointer
 *	in the local address space.
 *		The shmem index has two purposes: first, it gives us
 *	a simple model of how the world looks when a backend process
 *	initializes.  If something is present in the shmem index,
 *	it is initialized.	If it is not, it is uninitialized.	Second,
 *	the shmem index allows us to allocate shared memory on demand
 *	instead of trying to preallocate structures and hard-wire the
 *	sizes and locations in header files.  If you are using a lot
 *	of shared memory in a lot of different places (and changing
 *	things during development), this is important.
 *
 *		(c) In standard Unix-ish environments, individual backends do not
 *	need to re-establish their local pointers into shared memory, because
 *	they inherit correct values of those variables via fork() from the
 *	postmaster.  However, this does not work in the EXEC_BACKEND case.
 *	In ports using EXEC_BACKEND, new backends have to set up their local
 *	pointers using the method described in (b) above.
 *
 *		(d) memory allocation model: shared memory can never be
 *	freed, once allocated.	 Each hash table has its own free list,
 *	so hash buckets can be reused when an item is deleted.	However,
 *	if one hash table grows very large and then shrinks, its space
 *	cannot be redistributed to other tables.  We could build a simple
 *	hash bucket garbage collector if need be.  Right now, it seems
 *	unnecessary.
