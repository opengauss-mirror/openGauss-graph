# For time-series database, there may be a value with multiple fields (or tags, labels),
# many of sequence values are not what we want to collect, thus we need to filter by
# these fields, by setting some conditions. In this configuration file, users can
# define the fields (or conditions) for filtering sequence valuesâ€‹by themselves.

# For example,
# 1) we want to filter sequence values with the label 'app_name' from Prometheus, configure this:
#    app_name =
# 2) we want to filter sequence values from Prometheus that have the label 'db_name' and
# the label value is 'monitor_db' and 'system_db', we can configure it as:
#    db_name = monitor_db
#    db_name = system_db
