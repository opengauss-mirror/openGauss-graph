/*
 * query_planner
 *	  Generate a path (that is, a simplified plan) for a basic query,
 *	  which may involve joins but not any fancier features.
 *
 * Since query_planner does not handle the toplevel processing (grouping,
 * sorting, etc) it cannot select the best path by itself.  Instead, it
 * returns the RelOptInfo for the top level of joining, and the caller
 * (grouping_planner) can choose among the surviving paths for the rel.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 * root describes the query to plan
 * tlist is the target list the query should produce
 *		(this is NOT necessarily root->parse->targetList!)
 *
 * Output parameters:
 * final_rel contains the RelOptInfo for the top level of joining
 *
 * Note: the PlannerInfo node also includes a query_pathkeys field, which is
 * both an input and an output of query_planner().	The input value signals
 * query_planner that the indicated sort order is wanted in the final output
 * plan.  But this value has not yet been "canonicalized", since the needed
 * info does not get computed until we scan the qual clauses.  We canonicalize
 * it as soon as that task is done.  (The main reason query_pathkeys is a
 * PlannerInfo field and not a passed parameter is that the low-level routines
 * in indxpath.c need to see it.)
 *
 * Note: the PlannerInfo node includes other pathkeys fields besides
 * query_pathkeys, all of which need to be canonicalized once the info is
 * available.  See canonicalize_all_pathkeys.
