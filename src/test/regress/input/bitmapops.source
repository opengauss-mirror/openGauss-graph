-- Test bitmap AND and OR


-- Generate enough data that we can test the lossy bitmaps.

-- There's 55 tuples per page in the table. 53 is just
-- below 55, so that an index scan with qual a = constant
-- will return at least one hit per page. 59 is just above
-- 55, so that an index scan with qual b = constant will return
-- hits on most but not all pages. 53 and 59 are prime, so that
-- there's a maximum number of a,b combinations in the table.
-- That allows us to test all the different combinations of
-- lossy and non-lossy pages with the minimum amount of data
