-- problem:
-- system function log2() has some defacts. when passed the special value 0x8000000000000002,
-- incorrect value is returned. we have to fix the returned value.
-- but we only concern how many bytes is used to hold the diff value, not exlcuding how many bits.
-- so rewrite function SetDeltaBitsAndBytes() and rename it
